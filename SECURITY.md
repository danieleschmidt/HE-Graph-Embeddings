# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.9.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Private Disclosure Process

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@example.com
2. **Encrypt**: Use our PGP key (available at [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org))
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution Target**: Within 90 days

### Coordination

We follow responsible disclosure:
1. Confirm the vulnerability
2. Develop and test fixes
3. Prepare security advisory
4. Coordinate disclosure with reporter
5. Release patches and advisory simultaneously

## Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Security

#### Parameter Selection
- Use parameter recommendations from `SecurityEstimator` class
- Minimum 128-bit security level for production
- Regular updates based on cryptanalysis advances

#### Key Management
- Private keys must never leave client environment
- Use secure key generation with proper entropy
- Implement key rotation policies
- Zero out key material after use

#### Noise Budget
- Monitor noise budget during computation
- Bootstrap before noise exhaustion
- Implement automatic threshold checks
- Log noise budget warnings

### Implementation Security

#### Memory Safety
- Clear sensitive data from GPU memory
- Implement secure deletion for CPU memory
- Prevent timing side-channels
- Use constant-time comparisons

#### Input Validation
- Validate all ciphertext inputs
- Check parameter compatibility
- Verify graph structure integrity
- Sanitize user-provided configurations

#### Error Handling
- Don't leak sensitive information in errors
- Log security events appropriately
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use secure defaults

### Deployment Security

#### Access Control
- Implement proper authentication
- Use role-based access control
- Audit access to encrypted data
- Monitor for anomalous patterns

#### Network Security
- Use TLS 1.3+ for all communications
- Implement certificate pinning
- Validate all external inputs
- Use secure communication protocols

#### Container Security
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use minimal base images
- Run as non-root user
- Implement resource limits

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

1. **Automatic Parameter Validation**
   ```python
   context = heg.CKKSContext(...)
   context.validate_security_level()  # Ensures 128-bit security
   ```

2. **Noise Budget Tracking**
   ```python
   with heg.NoiseTracker() as tracker:
       # Computation
       if tracker.get_noise_budget() < threshold:
           # Automatic bootstrap
   ```

3. **Secure Key Generation**
   ```python
   keygen = heg.SecureKeyGenerator()
   keys = keygen.generate_keys(security_bits=128)
   ```

4. **Memory Sanitization**
   ```python
   with heg.SecureContext() as ctx:
       # Computation
   # Automatic cleanup on exit
   ```

## Known Security Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Side-Channel Resistance**: Not fully resistant to all timing attacks
2. **Fault Injection**: Limited protection against hardware faults
3. **Quantum Resistance**: CKKS is not quantum-resistant

### Mitigations

- Use in controlled environments
- Implement additional timing randomization
- Plan for post-quantum migration

## Security Audit

### Last Audit
- **Date**: Pending
- **Auditor**: TBD
- **Scope**: Cryptographic implementation
- **Results**: Will be published when available

### Planned Audits
- Q2 2025: Initial cryptographic review
- Q4 2025: Full security assessment
- Annual: Ongoing security reviews

## Bug Bounty Program

We plan to launch a bug bounty program in Q3 2025:
- **Scope**: Core cryptographic operations
- **Rewards**: $500 - $10,000 based on severity
- **Platform**: HackerOne (planned)
