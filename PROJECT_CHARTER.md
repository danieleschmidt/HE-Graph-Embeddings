# Project Charter: HE-Graph-Embeddings

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: HE-Graph-Embeddings  
**Project Type**: Open Source Research & Development  
**Start Date**: January 2025  
**Expected Duration**: 18 months to v1.0  
**Sponsor**: Daniel Schmidt / Terragon Labs  

## Problem Statement

Organizations possess valuable graph-structured data (social networks, financial transactions, molecular structures, supply chains) but cannot leverage graph neural networks for analysis due to privacy regulations, competitive concerns, or security requirements. Current solutions force a choice between data utility and privacy protection.

**Key Pain Points**:
- Medical institutions cannot share patient graph data for collaborative research
- Financial firms cannot analyze cross-institutional transaction networks
- Technology companies cannot process user behavior graphs without privacy risks
- Supply chain networks cannot be analyzed across competing organizations

## Project Vision

Enable practical privacy-preserving graph neural network computation through GPU-accelerated homomorphic encryption, allowing organizations to gain insights from sensitive graph data without compromising privacy or security.

## Mission Statement

Democratize secure graph analysis by providing an open-source, enterprise-grade platform that makes homomorphic encryption accessible to data scientists and machine learning engineers, enabling breakthrough applications in healthcare, finance, and other privacy-critical domains.
