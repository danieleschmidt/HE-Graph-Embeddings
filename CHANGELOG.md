## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-06

### ðŸš€ TERRAGON SDLC IMPLEMENTATION

This release implements the complete TERRAGON SDLC strategy with three generations of progressive enhancement, comprehensive quality gates, and global-first capabilities.

### Added - Generation 1: Make it Work
- **Enhanced CKKS Implementation**: Production-ready homomorphic encryption with proper key generation
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Enhanced GraphSAGE and GAT models with encrypted operations  
- **CUDA Integration**: GPU-accelerated homomorphic operations
- **FastAPI Service**: RESTful API with comprehensive health checks

### Added - Generation 2: Make it Robust
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Retry logic, circuit breakers, graceful degradation
- **Advanced Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs and security audit trails
- **Health Monitoring**: GPU monitoring, performance metrics, automated health checks
- **Security Framework**: Vulnerability scanning and policy enforcement (44+ checks)
- **Resource Management**: Memory-aware caching and adaptive strategies

### Added - Generation 3: Make it Scale  
- **Performance Optimization**: Resource pooling, batch processing, concurrent execution
- **Advanced Caching**: Multi-tier caching with intelligent eviction policies
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic request routing and performance-based scaling
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Real-time performance tracking and automated recovery

### Added - Quality Gates
